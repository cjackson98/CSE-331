Name: Chris Jackson
Time to complete: 3.5-4 hours
Feedback: Modulo arithmetic was kind of confusing. I didn't remember much about it from class.

Sources used: I used the "lecture9_completed_code" from D2l to help with my shrink and grow functions.
Also asked a question on Piazza regarding the hidden grow/hidden shrink/hidden all test cases.
