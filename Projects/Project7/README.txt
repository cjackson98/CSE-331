I used Zybooks section(s) 23.4, 24.9, 23.10 to help with understanding quadratic probing.
I asked a few questions on Piazza regarding the lookup/find functions and the string_difference.
I used lectures 14 and 15 for some conceptual help regarding hash tables.
I also talked over the string_difference function with my friend William who is a computer science major at Penn State
